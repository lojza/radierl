fork firh bugfixes and some improvements 
   * Missing link between server and its handlers (bug - causes losts of data)
   * Support for InputGigaWords and OutputGigaWords attributes and for vendor specific attributes.
   * Handle error on the UDP socket.
       When some error occurs on the UDP socket (e.g. ack is
       send to the peer which already close its socket), runtime
       sends a message {udp_error, Socket, Reason}.

       This message must be handled (otherwise procress fails on
       handle_info functin clause error). This is similar like
       tcp_error message, but it is not mentioned in the documentation.

The radierl project implements a RADIUS protocol stack.

Port the radius application to your environment:

	$ aclocal; autoheader; autoconf; automake --add-missing
	$ ./configure

Build the radius application and documentation:

	$ make

Test the radius application:

	$ make check

Install the radius application:

	$ make install

Port the example callbacks application to your environment:

	$ cd examples
	$ aclocal; autoheader; autoconf; automake --add-missing
	$ ./configure

Build the example callbacks application and documentation:

	$ make

Test the example callbacks applications:

	$ make check

Install the example callbacks application:

	$ make install

Initialize the example callbacks application:

	1> mnesia:create_schema([node()]).
	ok
	2> mnesia:start().
	ok
	3> radius_example:install([node()]).
	
	=INFO REPORT==== 30-Jan-2014::13:49:54 ===
	Created new radius_client table.
	
	=INFO REPORT==== 30-Jan-2014::13:49:55 ===
	Created new radius_user table.
	{ok,[radius_client,radius_user]}

Start the stack and example applications:

	4> application:start(radius).
	ok
	5> application:start(radius_example).
	ok
